He is a 2 1/2 y/o mix of at least Great Pyrenees & Anatolian Shepherd who sports a super soft, thick coat.\nHe is heartworm negative, up to date on shots, microchipped and neutered. He is recovering from a bad cough, and arrived with severe against-his-skin matting and flea dermatitis, with terribly itchy dry skin. He is responding well to treatment.\nHe loves to cuddle up beside you... on your feet or laying beside you on the sofa. He will hop on the bed for cuddles, but hops off when you lay down, preferring to sleep beside the bed on pillows or a doggy cot.\nHe is nicely house trained, and readily accepts newly introduced guests.\nHe is an excellent walker, dislikes thunderstorms and fireworks, but snuggles up to me or one of his foster brothers for comfort. He whines and paws when in a crate. He is calmest given free walk about the house, and enjoys patrols between naps.\nHe will make an excellent guardian. He has a very loud bark, so it is not recommended for apartment dwellers. He will loudly bark at unknown people from your yard, but does an enthusiastic wiggling butt dance for people he knows. He is good with cats.\nHe maintains a puppy-like enthusiastic playfulness, and will happily do \"zoomies\" all by himself if no one else wants to play. He doesn't pay attention to balls or frisbee, but adores his bone. He would likely love a playful older child and/ or large furr sibbling to run and play with him.\nHe is fostered in Tampa."},"mix":{"$t":"yes"},"shelterId":{"$t":"FL466"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2018-07-03T20:17:11Z"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{"option":[{"$t":"altered"},{"$t":"hasShots"},{"$t":"housetrained"},{"$t":"noCats"}]},"status":{"$t":"A"},"contact":{"phone":{},"state":{"$t":"FL"},"address2":{"$t":"Suite 209"},"email":{"$t":"Racing4Rescues@gmail.com"},"city":{"$t":"Pinellas Park"},"zip":{"$t":"33782"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"9753 - 66th St. N"}},"age":{"$t":"Adult"},"size":{"$t":"L"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/1/?bust=1508211065&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/1/?bust=1508211065&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/1/?bust=1508211065&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/1/?bust=1508211065&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/1/?bust=1508211065&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/2/?bust=1508211245&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/2/?bust=1508211245&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/2/?bust=1508211245&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/2/?bust=1508211245&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/2/?bust=1508211245&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"2"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/3/?bust=1508211245&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/3/?bust=1508211245&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/3/?bust=1508211245&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/3/?bust=1508211245&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/3/?bust=1508211245&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"3"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/4/?bust=1532050444&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"4"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/4/?bust=1532050444&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"4"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/4/?bust=1532050444&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"4"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/4/?bust=1532050444&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"4"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/4/?bust=1532050444&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"4"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/5/?bust=1532050444&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"5"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/5/?bust=1532050444&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"5"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/5/?bust=1532050444&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"5"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/5/?bust=1532050444&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"5"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/5/?bust=1532050444&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"5"},{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/6/?bust=1526840966&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"6"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/6/?bust=1526840966&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"6"},{"@size":"x","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/6/?bust=1526840966&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"6"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/6/?bust=1526840966&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"6"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/39667222/6/?bust=1526840966&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"6"}]}},"id":{"$t":"39667222"},"shelterPetId":{},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Pit Bull Terrier"}},"name":{"$t":"Dayton"},"sex":{"$t":"M"},"description":{"$t":"Dayton is 5 1/2 years old, neutered, 60lbs., UTD on vaccines and preventions, microchipped, housebroken, and crate trained.

The owner would not be able to care for Jake anymore so IMPS was called. He is a very shy guy and does best with men. He gets along with my other small dogs, we don't know about cats, but his personality indicates that there wouldn't be a problem. He loves to lay beside you on the couch when you are reading or watching TV and he REALLY loves to snuggle in a bed with a blanket, inside or outside a crate. Walks on a leash are much fun, new smells are always so interesting. Best of all, Jake is TOTALLY housebroken. He has had a dental and has had 2 non-cancerous lumps removed and is now ready for his furever home. Jake needs a quieter family to be really happy and that family must be willing to give Jake some time to be the loving little boy he is. \n\nNote: we will not fly this boy. \nIMPS Tag: 29755 \nADD DATE: 04/04/18\nIf you wish to adopt, please fill out our IMPS Min Pin Adoption Application \nIf you have previously submitted an Application form, there is no need to re-apply. \nFor more details, contact Janice: janscrib5@gmail.com"},"mix":{"$t":"no"},"shelterId":{"$t":"FL89"},"lastUpdate":{"$t":"2018-04-16T13:02:48Z"},"animal":{"$t":"Dog"}},{"options":{},"status":{"$t":"A"},"contact":{"phone":{"$t":"305-467-8998  "},"state":{"$t":"FL"},"address2":{},"email":{"$t":"vnero323@gmail.com"},"city":{"$t":"Pinellas Park"},"zip":{"$t":"33780"},"fax":{},"address1":{"$t":"P O Box 176"}},"age":{"$t":"Young"},"size":{"$t":"S"},"media":{"photos":{"photo":[{"@size":"pnt","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/13760044/1/?bust=1291034096&width=60&-pnt.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"fpm","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/13760044/1/?bust=1291034096&width=95&-fpm.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"x","$t":"http://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/13760044/1/?bust=1291034096&width=500&-x.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"pn","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/13760044/1/?bust=1291034096&width=300&-pn.jpg","@id":"1"},{"@size":"t","$t":"https://photos.petfinder.com/photos/pets/13760044/1/?bust=1291034096&width=50&-t.jpg","@id":"1"}]}},"id":{"$t":"13760044"},"shelterPetId":{},"breeds":{"breed":{"$t":"Miniature Pinscher"}},"name":{"$t":"Foster A MinPin"},"sex":{"$t":"F"},"description":{"$t":"Foster homes are urgently needed in Florida State \n\nDo you have a big heart and a passion for little min pins?
